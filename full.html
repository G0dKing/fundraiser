                <p><div class="firstword">N</div>ear the beginning of summer of 2022, I was hospitalized for over a month when a home-invader
                    entered my home and
                    critically injured me by impaling me through the lower abdomen with a decorative longsword. I
                    also have a traumatic
                    brain injury from getting struck in the head, and my left hand also sustained a great deal of
                    nerve-damage, as at
                    one point I caught the blade in an attempt to avoid a second hit to the head. I am only alive
                    because Honey
                    courageously caused the assailant to lose balance and fall, after which he fled the scene. He
                    has since been caught,
                    but I have not gotten any money out of the situation yet as of this time due to needlessly
                    complex bureaucratic
                    technicalities on top of the fact the attacker himself was destitute.</p>

                <p>Once I had been discharged from the hospital, my parents took me under their care at my childhood
                    home for the
                    remainder of my recovery. It was then I learned that nobody had contacted my landlord to tell
                    them what happened,
                    and that I had been evicted while in the hospital due to nonpayment of rent, and everything in
                    my apartment had been
                    thrown away, except for my laptop, which Honey had thoughtfully retrieved on the night of the
                    attack. Given that I
                    could barely walk, let alone work, I occupied myself by expanding my knowledge using online
                    resources to learn the
                    craft of music production, as well as teach myself about artificial intelligence and coding,
                    with the intention of
                    building up a solid portfolio to help with future job searches.</p>

                <p>Unfortunately, my parents did not understand that I wasn't just "wasting time playing around on
                    my computer." They
                    also seemed to resent me for the fact I was dependent on them once again as a 34-year-old man,
                    even though it had
                    been their decision to move me into their house; I hadn't even been consulted about it. Tensions
                    grew, and as soon
                    as I had "healed enough" in their opinion, they kicked me out. My mother literally wrote out a
                    notice to quit the
                    premises and taped it to my bedroom door, threatening to add a second eviction to my already
                    compromised history.
                    Also keep in mind that I hadn't worked for well over a year while my injuries healed, and had no
                    savings from
                    before. They literally dropped me off with what few things I still owned outside of a hotel, and
                    haven't spoken to
                    me since.</p>

                <p>This was around 6 months ago.</p>

                <p>Honey's situation at home wasn't much better due to her family's difficulty accepting that her
                    diagnosed autism and
                    C-PTSD (stemming from the horrific abuse and torture she was previously subjected to during a
                    prolonged hostage
                    situation years before) as valid contributors to her apparent executive dysfunction; this
                    influenced her decision to
                    join me at my parents' house to help care for me in the aftermath of my hospitalization. As
                    such, she had no choice
                    but to leave my parents' as well, and joined me on the streets.</p>

                <p>The following months were spent living in hotels that we paid for via gigs, odd-jobs, and
                    freelance work both on- and
                    offline. The increased cost of living in recent years has made it virtually impossible to save
                    any money, as
                    everything we made each day had to be immediately spent on food and shelter. Sometimes we
                    couldn't make enough in
                    time, and more than once we spent all night wandering in the snow and rain in search of a safe
                    place to sleep.
                    Gaining and maintaining full-time employment was not possible under these circumstances, as we
                    both suffered
                    physical and mental disabilities and were simply too dirty and exhausted to present ourselves
                    adequately to
                    potential job interviewers. The few things we managed to purchase or were given to us were kept
                    in a
                    centrally-located storage facility. Occasionally friends would let us come over so we could do
                    our laundry and clean
                    ourselves up, but this was rare and never lasted longer than a night or two.</p>

                <p>Then, one day, an online acquaintance who had been made aware of my situation by a mutual friend,
                    reached out and
                    offered to let us move into the basement of their house rent-free for the first month, followed
                    by a very reasonable
                    portion of the house's total rent-cost. I immediately sensed some red-flags, but I didn't have
                    any other options.
                    So, with the help of our newfound benefactor and her boyfriend, Honey and I gathered our things
                    from the storage
                    unit and brought them to our new home. But nothing could have prepared us for what we say when
                    we walked into that
                    house.</p>

                <p>The place was trashed. Not just trashed; it was absolutely destroyed. I have literally seen less
                    disgusting places
                    featured on the show "Hoarders." The floor was totally obscured by an avalanche of trinkets,
                    knick-knacks, dishes,
                    and undiscarded refuse. Additionally, there was a solid layer of old animal dander covering
                    every inch of every
                    surface (their 3 cats and gigantic Akita dog were utterly neglected).</p>

                <p>Our half of the (unfinished) basement was totally filled with dusty furniture stained with old
                    cat urine, and the
                    tile floor was smeared with ancient feces and the long-decomposed remnants of various rodents.
                    The other half of the
                    basement contained the washer and dryer; every item of clothing they possessed had been strewn
                    in piles upon the
                    dirty floor, and the air was rank with the scent of mildew and rot.</p>

                <p>Despite this, I stayed optimistic, and tried to rally everyone into working together to get
                    things cleaned up. It
                    took a week, but I managed to single-handedly turn that disgusting basement into a reasonably
                    clean living space.
                    Unfortunately, the rest of the house only got worse. Instead of washing the mountain of
                    mold-covered dishes piled in
                    their kitchen, they opted instead to simply put them outside in the backyard in tubs of stagnant
                    water, from which
                    would later emerge swarms of newborn mosquitos.</p>

                <p>As for the bathroom, the toilet didn't have a lever, and to flush one had to reach their hand
                    into the tank and
                    manually pull it upwards. And somehow, someone had managed to misplace the entire doorknob of
                    the back door, leaving
                    a wide circular opening into the house right next to the clouds of mosquito spawn.</p>

                <p>And then there was the fighting. Almost every day, housemates would start <i>screaming</i> at
                    each other, and often
                    the shouting matches escalated until one of them started throwing and smashing whatever was in
                    reach at the time.
                    Flatscreen TVs, dishware, electronics, jewelry, picture frames, mirrors, chairs, propane
                    tanks...to them, there was
                    no set-rule that defined what did or did not constitute as a projectile.</p>

                <p>On more than one occasion, one of them literally pulled out a knife and started cutting her arm,
                    all the while
                    screaming at her boyfriend to stop hurting her - right in front of us. It soon became apparent
                    that they expected us
                    to act as their live-in relationship therapists, as they would directly involve Honey and I,
                    pulling us into their
                    conflicts. Every day spent living there was filled with tension, uncertainty, and a huge amount
                    of stress.</p>

                <p>Then, one day, their collective anger, normally reserved for each other, unified to form an
                    unprecedented display of
                    overwhelming ire, not at each other, but at me, blaming me for "breaking their computer" which
                    no longer worked
                    after it had been used as a projectile earlier that week. It was more like, I couldn't fix it,
                    and in a moment of
                    weakness, I told them that maybe their computer would still work if they hadn't thrown it at
                    each other.</p>

                <p>The barrage of insults and threats that ensued was ridiculous. It was so much that I walked out
                    of the house and down
                    the street, in hopes their outburst might lessen with time. After assuring them that we would
                    return soon, and being
                    assured in turn that she was not to blame for this conflict, Honey joined me at a nearby Dairy
                    Queen, where we
                    discussed our options. In the end, we both came to the conclusion that our present living
                    situation had gotten out
                    of hand, and was unsustainable.</p>

                <p>But when we returned to the house and tried to enter it, we found the door had been locked and
                    barricaded. Then the
                    window opened very slightly, and through the gap told us that they were afraid of us, and said
                    they’d call the
                    police on us if we didn't leave. We asserted that everything we owned was still inside, but
                    ultimately backed down
                    when it became they would continue to escalate to the point of violence, punctuated by the
                    thunderous roar of
                    expletives that came reverberating out of the 6'4" frame of the former U.S. Marine.</p>

                <p>In addition to threatening us with physical violence, they also threatened to ruin our
                    reputations online with lies
                    that we were addicted to fentanyl (completely untrue and without basis, though this statement
                    causes me to suspect
                    they were probably on it themselves). I called a friend, who agreed to come get Honey and I and
                    let us stay with
                    them for a few days. The next morning, we awoke to a slew of messages, blaming us for
                    "vandalizing the yard"
                    (really?) and accusing us of stealing from them; ironic, considering they had literally just
                    stolen everything we
                    own from us.</p>

                <p>Without empathy, remorse, or justification beyond "we are mad," they sentenced us to homelessness
                    with absolutely
                    nothing to our name, no money, nothing we could try to sell, nothing to wear except for the
                    clothes we already wore,
                    and our phones. In the middle of the night, in a bad part of town, with heavy rain on the
                    forecast.</p>

                <p>This brings us to the present day, about a week after we were forced to leave with nothing. As I
                    write this, I have
                    managed to secure a hotel room until tomorrow morning. It is uncertain whether or not I will
                    generate the ~$100
                    necessary to book it again before checkout. It is entirely dependent on our ability to get as
                    much money as possible
                    today. I have not eaten today, as I chose to let Honey use the last of our money to begin the
                    process of getting a
                    new ID so she can search for jobs, as her old one is still in that house. We will either figure
                    it out, or we won't.
                </p>

                <p>I am grateful that if nothing else, tonight will be spent indoors.</p>

                <p>My friends have been made aware of the situation; none of them can help us. Honey's family lives
                    too far to offer
                    much in the way of support. My family won't respond to me at all. But I will not succumb to
                    despair. I will fight as
                    hard and for as long as necessary until I can pull us out of this nightmare that neither of us
                    deserve. We are not
                    bad people. </p>
                    <p>I hold firmly to my belief that one day, we will at last come to find the end of suffering, and in fact find ourselves able to ease the suffering of those around us. For though we may now suffer, we are grateful. To suffer is to know  pain, but it is also to know strength, humility, compassion, courage, and wisdom. I am grateful for these gifts, and that by them we are able to share love with those whom we cherish, bringing an end to pain. For as we quietly transcend ourselves, and become as Love, made real and manifest, we become as surrogates to the begotten ephemereal, that which is made tangible by the act of sharing love, through which Beauty beholds itself, in its sublime quintessence, a perfection present within us all, that to know is to glimpse a spark of the divine.</p>
