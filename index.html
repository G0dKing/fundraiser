                <div class="datetime">WHO WE ARE</div>
                <p>My name is Alex. I am reaching out for help during an incredibly challenging time
                    affecting both
                    myself and my significant other, Honey. We are seeking contributions from generous
                    donors to help us
                    recover from an extremely upsetting sequence of events and unjust actions taken
                    against us that have
                    destroyed our physical and mental health and left us entirely destitute due to little
                    fault of our
                    own. Below you will find a description of our immediate situation we are facing and
                    the steps we
                    will
                    ultimately end up taking. After that you will find a more complete summary of the
                    events leading up
                    to our present situation, in the event you'd like to know a bit more about the trials
                    we've faced.
                </p>

                <div class="datetime">WHAT HAPPENED</div>
                <p>Several days ago, our housemate/landlord <strong>denied us entry</strong> to our
                    rental property
                    without any legal process, went through, <strong>destroyed, stole, or
                        disposed</strong> <strong>all
                        of our belongings</strong>, and <strong>threatened us with</strong>
                    <strong>violence</strong>,
                    <strong>litigation, and the spread of false accusations</strong> on social media if
                    we even
                    attempted
                    to get our things back. They claim to have found fentanyl in our possessions
                    —<strong>a blatant
                        lie</strong>— after <strong>illegally</strong> entering our space and conducting
                    an
                    <strong>unlawful search-and-seizure of our property</strong>, and is using this
                    <strong>false
                        accusation</strong> to further <strong>intimidate and extort</strong> us. There
                    have also been
                    <strong>threats</strong> to our physical well-being should we return to the property.
                </p>
                <p><strong>As a result,</strong> we have <strong>lost access</strong> to all our personal
                    items,
                    including essentials like clothing and sentimental items, and our money as well,
                    <strong>leaving us
                        with literally nothing</strong> but the clothes on our backs. We've contacted
                    local police but
                    as
                    we have nowhere to put our stuff once we get it back, things have been at a sort of
                    standstill. Law
                    enforcement has been very unhelpful, and we wish to limit our interaction with them
                    until we can
                    retain a legal representative.</p>

                <div class="datetime">OUR CURRENT SITUATION</div>
                <p>We have <strong>nowhere to stay</strong> and <strong>no money</strong> to secure
                    temporary shelter
                    beyond a single night at the cheapest hotel we could find. Our family won't help us,
                    and while our
                    friends do what they can, none of them have the means to provide anything beyond
                    occasionally
                    letting
                    us stay with them for a night or two.</p>

                <h4>IMMEDIATE NEEDS</h4>
                <p>We <strong>urgently need financial assistance</strong> to cover basic necessities such
                    as shelter,
                    food, and clothing while we work to resolve the legal issues and recover our
                    belongings.</p>
                <p>Your generous contributions will help us:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Secure temporary housing, food, and basic amenities.</li>
                    <li>Get legal assistance to fight the false accusations and recover our belongings.
                    </li>
                    <li>Cover transportation and other essential costs to ensure our safety and
                        well-being during this
                        difficult time.</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>WE NEED YOUR HELP</h4>
                <p>Though we are resourceful and determined individuals who have always found ways to
                    overcome
                    challenges, this situation has left us with <strong>limited options and an</strong>
                    <strong>urgent
                        need for support</strong>. Your help will provide us with the immediate relief we
                    need to get
                    back on our feet and navigate this legal nightmare. Without it, there is a
                    <strong>high chance that
                        we will be further preyed upon and exploited</strong> <strong>due to our
                        vulnerability</strong>,
                    or that we will succumb to the harsh reality that is life on the streets.</p>
                <p>We are <strong>incredibly grateful</strong> for any assistance you can provide. This
                    experience has
                    been a harsh reminder of how quickly things can spiral out of control due to someone
                    else's actions.
                    With your support, we hope to <strong>rebuild our lives, gain meaningful employment,
                        and rejoin
                        society</strong>, once we can finally move forward from this distressing conflict
                    and the events
                    leading up to it.</p>
                <p><strong>Thank you</strong> for taking the time to read our story and for any help you
                    can offer.</p>
                <p><em>With gratitude,</em></p>
                <p>Alex and Honey</p>
